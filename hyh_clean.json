Since coming to the US less than a year ago, Katherin continues to dedicate herself to her studies.   Her new high school has an orchestra, and she wanted to join to have something familiar and comfortable as compared to the challenges of learning English.  However, with no viola available she has had the challenge of trying to learn to play the violin in addition to all the other challenges she has faced.  Having a viola would give Katherin the opportunity to be successful at something she enjoys, while she continues to focus on her academic pursuits.   Of playing the viola, Katherin said “When I play, my heart is happy and free”.  \r\n \r\nHer orchestra has the opportunity to go to the University of Georgia in November for a concert and additional instruction, and if they do well could be invited back for further opportunities.  She sees this as an opportunity to learn about US colleges and improve her performance at the same time. \r\nUnaccompanied children served by Catholic Charities Atlanta are children who cross our borders and have no parent or legal guardian who is available to provide for their care and physical custody. For a limited number of Unaccompanied Children, the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement funds home studies and post-release services by social services providers to help ensure children are released into safe placements and to facilitate family and community integration after reunification. This is the case for Katherin.",

Wilder’s family could not afford to pay for his education and so he was forced to drop out of school. When he arrived in Alabama, the local school refused to accept him because he was 17 years old. Fortunately, he was able to enroll in ESL/GED classes at the local community college. His mother changed her work schedule so she can drive him to class every day.

His primary interest in getting his GED was so that he could take college classes. Juan is a talented artist and designer. He is interested in learning how to use CAD to enhance his employment opportunities in the future. Again, working with MEP he enrolled in a CAD class in Fall 2019.  He needed computer for this class.  AAN volunteers helped him to purchase an appropriate computer.  Juan paid for the computer. In October during a lightening storm while Juan was working in the barn, lightening struck his trailer home.  The computer was ruined.  He needs a new computer to continue the CAD class and take additional classes.  He'd like to buy a refurbished computer from the same computer store where he got the first computer.  This store can transfer all his files from the ruined computer to the new computer as part of the purchase price.\r\n$225 was donated towards this item.\r\nVeronica found someone to make up the difference.

Furthermore, the shelter does not allow them to cook, so connecting them with food pantries has not been helpful. We are hoping to provide them with temporary help to get cooked food (primarily for dinner) while their immigration cases progress further and until they are authorized to work and support themselves. \r\nCheck was mailed to the United African Organization.",

When I was young, I contracted Polio and lost the use of my left leg. Right now, I get around with the combination of a leg brace I have altered to pick up my leg when I walk and a wheelchair. My 9- year old daughter has started school and was accepted to an afterschool program that helps her with homework and provides additional English class. The bus does not provide transportation home from this program so I have been using my wheelchair to go to school and pick her up. It is a long distance to use a regular wheelchair, the streets are steep, and the concrete is uneven. It is very very difficult to get back and forth. Removing my daughter from this program is not an option because I want her to learn as much as she can. An electric mobility chair would allow me to make the journey to pick up my daughter in a much safer and easier way.  \r\n\r\nThank you to a generous donor for reducing this request amount by $100.00!\r\nFacebook Fundraiser - $350.00",

  "donationDescription": " I work at a dairy farm in the Upper Valley averaging 72 hours a week. I live in a small house with my sister, her husband, and their 8 month old baby. The house only has one bedroom meaning I usually sleep in the living room. I don’t have a car, and because of my schedule it is very difficult for me to find the time to leave the farm to buy the things that I need. Our house gets very hot in the summer and we haven’t been sleeping well and my nephew has been waking up frequently at night because of the heat. An air conditioning would make such a great difference in our lives and it would allow us to get the rest we need to continue with our essential work. I want to thank everyone who has been so kind to help us already and may god bless all of you. -Rosita",

He regularly sends money to his mother, grandmother and grandfather in Mexico.  He sends $100 monthly for food and more for medication.  The family has diabetes and heart problems and require medications regularly. When the pandemic hit, Antonio was laid off from his job.   He starts a new job in a week.  Since he has been laid off, he has not been able to send money home and will need to wait two weeks before he receives a paycheck from the new job. Antonio is very worried about his family, particularly his grandfather who requires several medications.  Funding this request would help tide this family over until Antonio can start sending money again.",

Summer is very intense with the high temperatures, and there are eight people living in my house. The milking stations, each with over 200 cows, get really hot in the summer with temperatures over 90 Fahrenheit, which makes the shifts exhausting. When we get home the house is very hot as well and makes it difficult for us to get a good night's sleep. In terms of the boots, I currently own a really worn out pair of this brand of boots, to the point in which I have been dealing with sore feet on a more frequent basis.

  "donationDescription": " I want to thank you for your generosity and I also want to share with you my story. I’ve been here in Vermont for 5 years. My husband has been working at the same farm for 10 years. I am taking care of the calves at the farm. My shifts start every morning at 3:00 am, even in winter. I like cows a lot and taking care of the calves is something that I enjoy. But poor creatures, they get separated from their mom when they are young and they cry for their mother. There are many times in which they become so depressed that they refuse to eat, and I have to remove my gloves in the cold in order to coax them into drinking the milk. I like cows a lot and when they separate the calves they are so rough and kick around so much that you end up crying. They don’t know what’s going on and it’s not their fault.\r\nThe harder aspect of my job is having to clean the troughs the cows eat from. We use acids to clean them and sometimes I accidentally forget to put on my gloves. I end up hurting my hands, but I keep working. Whenever the boss sees me, he tells me he loves me in English and in the past he would also give me a hug. It’s because he sees me singing to the calves often; they like hearing me sing.\r\n I work nearly 78 hours per week. Tuesday is my day off, but I cook and sell food for the farm community and I also clean houses because I am still paying off the debt from childbirth, a lot of money is discounted from my check.\r\nMy child was born 2 years ago here in Vermont and I had to stop working to take care of him, but I needed the money to send it to my mother because my husband and I were building her a house, so we decided to send our kid to Mexico with my mother so I could continue working. This decision was the hardest ever, but my mother is very happy taking care of him. My husband and I are now building a house for us and for our 2 year old in Veracruz. We are also saving money for his education.\r\nMy husband and I are asking for a pair of sneakers and hiking sandals because in the summer our feet get tired and really hot in boots. I like Vermont a lot. The people are really nice. I like the lakes and the people are great with us. They love me a lot at our farm. Everyone respects me. I also want to thank you for your generous donations, they mean a lot to us because with our shifts we hardly have time to do any shopping. And there are police patrols all over the roads, so we just go from our house to the farm and back. Thank you. May God spread all his blessings to you and your families.",

He continued to work even after the fracture but had surgery on Wednesday 6/10/20 at Porter Hospital in Middlebury, VT. Carlos, a Mexican citizen, is in America to earn money to better support his family in Mexico which consists of his aging parents, wife and son who has muscular dystrophy.  Carlos pays for his son's bi-weekly medical visits with a specialist.  Carlos does not qualify for any medical insurance plan and does not receive medical insurance through his work.  He cannot claim relatives in Mexico as dependents for purposes of financial assistance through the hospital.  He has incurred medical bills amounting to tens of thousands of dollars.  Making payments on this bill will severely inhibit his ability to continue to provide for his family.  Carlos would appreciate any support to help him pay this bill.

I have only been in Vermont for three months and though I have felt nostalgic being away from home, the farm community has been very welcoming.  I come from a remote community in the highlands of Chiapas State of Southern Mexico, in the border with Guatemala. At home, I lived with my mother and my 2 younger brothers. We are very much uncommunicated because they live by the mountains and there’s no internet reception in my town. So far the weather hasn’t treated me badly yet I have heard that Vermont winters are very long and cold. The farmworkers here have been so nice to me, they have supported me in many ways. I have learnt a lot about the dairy farm and the cows. I like it a lot and all the money I make, I’m sending it to my mother to support her with my brothers. I work 75 hrs a week and the community here has become my family. Being only seventeen I have had to adapt and mature at an early age but I know that this is an investment I am making for the betterment of myself and my family. \r\nCooking for me is a way of decompressing, and also a therapy to distract myself from our hard labor at the farm. One of my house mates is teaching me how to make cheese. I would also appreciate it if you can contribute with Rennet tablets so I can make my own cheese to share with my housemates. I would also very much appreciate it if you can support me with a manual corn mill to grind corn in order to make tortillas.  I miss my mother’s handmade tortillas and I would love to make them for the dairy farm community. Finally I would also appreciate receiving an AC unit so that I can have for the rest of the summer and the summers that await me.",

  "donationDescription": "I have been working at this dairy farm for 12 years. Sometimes I have worked up to 80 hours in one week. I am very happy in Vermont however not having a car, it is very difficult for me to find a way to get my basic needs. Summer is very intense with the high temperatures, and there are eight people living in my house. The milking stations, each with over 200 cows, get really hot in the summer with temperatures over 90 Fahrenheit, which makes the shifts exhausting. When we get home the house is very hot as well and makes it difficult for us to get a good night's sleep. In terms of the boots, I currently own a really worn out pair of this brand of boots, to the point in which I have been dealing with sore feet on a more frequent basis. It would mean the world to me to be able to upgrade to a new pair of boots. I want to thank all the kind donors who are willing to support us with our basic needs. May God bless you all for your generosity.",

I have only been in Vermont for three months and though I have felt nostalgic being away from home, the farm community has been very welcoming.  I come from a remote community in the highlands of Chiapas State of Southern Mexico, in the border with Guatemala. At home, I lived with my mother and my 2 younger brothers. We are very much uncommunicated because they live by the mountains and there’s no internet reception in my town. So far the weather hasn’t treated me badly yet I have heard that Vermont winters are very long and cold. The farmworkers here have been so nice to me, they have supported me in many ways. I have learnt a lot about the dairy farm and the cows. I like it a lot and all the money I make, I’m sending it to my mother to support her with my brothers. I work 75 hrs a week and the community here has become my family. Being only seventeen I have had to adapt and mature at an early age but I know that this is an investment I am making for the betterment of myself and my family. \r\nCooking for me is a way of decompressing, and also a therapy to distract myself from our hard labor at the farm. One of my house mates is teaching me how to make cheese. I would also appreciate it if you can contribute with Rennet tablets so I can make my own cheese to share with my housemates. I would also very much appreciate it if you can support me with a manual corn mill to grind corn in order to make tortillas.  I miss my mother’s handmade tortillas and I would love to make them for the dairy farm community. Finally I would also appreciate receiving an AC unit so that I can have for the rest of the summer and the summers that await me.",

I have two kids with my wife and I moved here because it was difficult to find a job and I promised my wife that I was going to give her the best which is what she deserves. There were times when I was in my town that we didn’t even have money to buy tortillas. It was very hard. And my family is worth every sacrifice. I send them all my money, and we have a dream to build a little house. I work 75 hrs a week, and every time someone gets sick I cover for them because I’m blessed to have a job and to be able to support my family. I also send money to my mother.

I have worked at a dairy farm for more than 5 years, and before I was working in the NorthEast Kingdom at another farm. I am very content at the farm that I am at because we receive good treatment. I work an average of 72 hours a week. I am from Martinez de la Torre, a small town in Veracruz Mexico. When I left my hometown more than 7 years ago it took me more than a month to get here to NH. My cousin was already here working so he convinced me to give it a try because the situation in my hometown was difficult. Not only the social aspect was getting scary and violent, but also it was very hard to find a job. I am single. I help my parents and some other relatives. I provide for them. I miss my mother a lot, but it makes me happy that with the money that I’m sending for them she is making improvements in her house and she is taking care of my dad’s health. Thank you so much for your help. I am so grateful that I have a job to support my family. I need a pair of  Men’s Workman Waterproof Insulated Boots, these would help me a lot because I take long shifts at the milk station and it's often muddy and slippery.

  "donationDescription": "Hello, My name is Andrew and I come from Martinez de la Torre in Veracruz, Mexico. I have only been in the Upper Valley for about two years but the treatment I have received from the people of Vermont and New Hampshire has been superior to what I received in my previous location in Michigan. I am a father of three children, two sons and one daughter, but they are all back home in Mexico with my wife. Moving to the United States has been one of the biggest sacrifices I have made in my lifetime, especially leaving my whole family behind and missing out from some of the prime years of my children. Back in Mexico I worked as a handyman but the level of pay was not enough to sustain my family or provide them with the stability that they deserve. Currently I work an average of 70+ hours  at the farm and most of that money I am sending home to pay for my children's education, and for their food and housing. Even though it is hard being without my family, I thank the world everyday for keeping me healthy to continue to take part in this labor that I have grown a great affection towards. I would be eternally thankful if you could help me through your generous funds to have access to one or more of the items I am requesting above. Your gifts are not only a donation, but they make a tremendous difference in giving us the tools and comfort we need to continue to take part in our jobs to the best of our ability. Thank you for your graceful work.",

The economical situation in the region of Mexico from where I am from was in very bad conditions so my sister convinced me to come to this region in search of better financial opportunity. Being only 20 years old, I decided to make this difficult decision to move to a new country, and a different culture because I know that with hard work I will hopefully be able to reach a sufficiently stable financial situation to go back to Mexico and pursue a college education. I hope to at some point in my life get a degree in Business and Administration and my dream is to open some sort of sustainable business back in my hometown that will be a strong source of employment and create good financial stability. Currently I am working at a dairy farm and I work an average of 60 hour weeks, of which I mainly spend milking cows. Currently my sister handed me down her old pair of boots and would greatly appreciate a new pair of work boots that will hopefully last me for several years. I am also requesting a pair of comfortable Nike sneakers because I spend a lot of time helping my sister with her newborn son and helping her with her cooking business. Thank you so much for all that you do for our community!",

It has been so hard to be so far away from my parents, especially because I haven’t been able to see them physically for the last eight years. I work an average of 10-12 hour shifts six days a week and just a few years ago I decided to take the night shifts which go from 1am-1pm because the pay is slightly improved. At times, it has been tough for me to stay motivated, and passionate but the farm community has been so welcoming and supportive to me. One of my highlights every week is getting together with farm workers from different farms to play soccer on Fridays and Sundays. Even though both those days I work at 1am, soccer helps me so much in liberating any stress I might have. I am hoping that one of you would be so kind in donating a pair of work boots for my labor.

I sometimes work up to 78 hrs a week. I have been very homesick but I’m thankful for the opportunity to be able to have a job now more than ever. It is very hard in my community in Mexico with Coronavirus. I send most of my money to my parents to support my siblings. I need a pair of boots to survive the winter.

For those without English – the majority—keeping track of key documents and providing them when needed is challenging. Papers are lost or misplaced. Staff time is lost too. A solution emerged when one of our recent Burmese arrivals came with their own binder with plastic inserts containing their important documents. Staff recognized how this simple tool is the solution to this nagging problem, a problem that could result in the delay of critical supports. With this request, we look forward to helping our next 10 refugee families stay organized and more involved in their resettlement process.\r\n \r\nJewish Family and Community Services runs many programs for refugees and vulnerable immigrants living in Pittsburgh.

I want to thank you all for being so kind and helping us with winter clothes for work. I don’t have a car and I don’t go out anywhere.

I don’t have a car which makes it even harder. I arrived 4 years ago. I have been working at a dairy farm in Vermont since then. I work 74 hrs a week.  I have different shifts milking cows at the barns and supervising the robots and the milk production in an area with 200 cows. To be able to perform my job well I need special boots to protect my feet from the cold weather. I am hoping that Hearts you Hold can support me with this need. I have 2 kids in Mexico.

I have never seen the snow in my life. I work at a dairy farm 74 hrs a week.  I have different shifts milking cows at the barns and supervising the robots and the milk production in an area with over 200 cows. I’m 20 years old and I’m a hardworking man. I’m in need of some winter gear to get me through this season. I would be grateful if Hearts You Hold could support me with a couple of things, I need a jacket, a pair of mittens and a hat. Thank You Hearts You Hold and Happy Christmas!",

Arline is living in Queens with her fiancé and young daughter. Since her baby is only a few months old, Arline is nervous about putting her in childcare so young, especially in the COIVD-19 pandemic, and is unable to work while she cares for her daughter full time. Arline’s fiancé is working, but his income is barely enough to support the young family. Arline was a human rights lawyer for children and adolescents for over 10 years in Venezuela, and hopes to one day practice law in the U.S. When her daughter is a bit older, Arline would like to start working again and start the process of passing the New York bar exam. While Arline is not working, the family is struggling to afford basic necessities like diapers for their daughter. This donation of diapers would allow Arline and her fiancé to keep their daughter safe, clean, and healthy this month. Your help will alleviate financial stress for the family and allow them to focus on the wellbeing of their child.",

On Saturday 6/6/2020 he injured his foot. The ex-ray showed a fracture  that required surgery.  He continued to work even after the fracture but had surgery on Wednesday 6/10/20 at Porter Hospital in Middlebury, VT. Carlos, a Mexican citizen, is in America to earn money to better support his family in Mexico which consists of his aging parents, wife and son who has muscular dystrophy.  Carlos pays for his son's bi-weekly medical visits with a specialist.  Carlos does not qualify for any medical insurance plan and does not receive medical insurance through his work.  He cannot claim relatives in Mexico as dependents for purposes of financial assistance through the hospital.  He has incurred medical bills amounting to tens of thousands of dollars.  Making payments on this bill will severely inhibit his ability to continue to provide for his family.  Carlos would appreciate any support to help him pay this bill. The total bill left to pay is still over $10,000.00. The original bill was $31,200.00.",

The pandemic hit Rohan hard and delayed a lot of their plans. Living alone thousands of miles away from any friends or family has been difficult, but Rohan is rebuilding a new life nonetheless. After months of searching for work in the pandemic, Rohan is now working as a nurse’s assistant at a healthcare center in Queens.

Rohan is happy to be mostly self-sufficient and renting a place of their own. The room they rent is small and they still have a lot of needs however. Without a full kitchen of their own, Rohan needs a mini fridge to hold food. This is something that Rohan cannot afford on their own, but would really improve their standard of living. A mini fridge for their rented room would allow Rohan to cook more and save money on pre-prepared food. Rohan would be grateful for any help getting this item. ",

  "donationDescription": "Elsa is an asylee from El Salvador who is living and working in Bronx, NY. Elsa traveled to the U.S. in 2019 and was granted asylum. She is the mother of two children, a 6 year old son who traveled with her from El Salvador and a new baby girl who was born here in New York. Elsa hopes that she can make a better life for her children in New York and is working hard to build that life despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.  Elsa was recently able to save up enough to get an apartment for herself and her children in the Bronx. Living alone with her children thousands of miles away from any friends or family has been difficult, but Elsa is happy to have their new apartment.  Elsa and the children still have a lot of needs as a newly arrived asylees, and their apartment is mostly empty. Elsa does not have the money to fully furnish and decorate her new apartment. Catholic Charities is helping Elsa get donated furniture for the apartment, but there are still many items she needs to buy herself. Right now, the item Elsa needs most is blinds or curtains for the windows in her apartment. The apartment Elsa rents has two windows, and without blinds anyone outside could see in at night. Elsa lives on the first floor and worries for the safety of her children in the apartment if others can see in. She would really appreciate any help getting blinds for their windows so she and her children can have privacy and feel safer in their apartment. Any help or donation would be appreciated.",

  "donationDescription": "Sobia J. is an asylee from Pakistan who gained asylum status in 2019. She was a journalist in Pakistan and has extensive experience in human rights advocacy and research. This brave work put Sobia in danger, however, and she was targeted for her political views and forced to flee to the U.S. Sobia has two young children, a 7-year-old daughter and a son who just turned 2. She is not working right now, but has been looking for a job for some time. The Covid-19 pandemic has affected her ability to work since there are fewer jobs available and safe childcare is increasingly difficult to find. Sobia hopes to eventually return to a career in journalism and continue researching and exposing human rights abuses. Sobia is working towards self-sufficiency and hopes to be able to provide for her children fully and give them a safe and comfortable life, but she still needs some help. Without any disposable income, Sobia cannot buy the computer she needs that would allow her to work from home while safely caring for her children. This donation would go a long way in helping Sobia achieve self-sufficiency.",

Yisel is currently living with family in upper Manhattan and receiving services from Catholic Charities Community Services Refugee Resettlement program. Yisel is working toward getting her Employment Authorization Document (EAD) so she can work in the U.S. and earn money to support herself and her family. Yisel’s family is helping her with the large expense of applying for an EAD. Yisel wants to work and was a professional volleyball player in Cuba. She is interested in pursuing education or nursing. While she is in the process of getting work authorization, Yisel is working on improving her English language skills through a full-time intensive ESOL class. In order to participate in this class, which is being held online due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Yisel needs a computer. Yisel currently has no form of income and her family, who are already housing her and helping her pay for her work authorization, cannot afford to buy her a laptop. This donation will allow Yisel to safely learn English and participate fully in her classes. It will also help Yisel with job searching and potentially working or attending higher education remotely once she is settled and has her EAD approved.",

Yhimkely traveled to New York with his wife, Jenifer, and four children to flee the violence and instability in his home region of Colombia. The family has been working with Catholic Charities and receiving social services. Yhimkely and Jenifer have been working hard to integrate into their new community in Brooklyn by learning English, setting up their home, helping their children in school, and looking for permanent work. This week, Yhimkely was hired by the MTA as a subway cleaner! He is excited to start his new job and thankful that he can support his family again. In order to stay safe at work and follow the requited dress code, Yhimkely needs to buy a pair of steel-toed construction boots to wear at work. Since he has not worked for some time during his journey to the U.S. and first few months in New York as he looked for work, Yhimkely does not have the spare income to pay for good work boots. This donation would allow Yhimkely to be safe at work and earn a necessary income to support his family.",

Emma joined her husband in New York in February 2021 as a derivative asylee after he was granted asylum. Emma is currently not working because she does not speak English and must take care of her children. She wishes to work, however, so she can bring in more money for her family and allow them to be financially stable. As Emma looks for appropriate work, she is learning to speak English. She recently enrolled in an ESOL class, but the class is held online due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Emma currently has a difficult time accessing her class and must walk to the public library to access a computer. This donation of a laptop would allow Emma to attend her ESOL classes online and learn English safely while continuing to care for her children at home. Once Emma finishes her English classes and begins to search for a job, the laptop will continue to help Emma access important resources and search for and apply to jobs online. This donation will have a great impact on the life of Emma and her family and provide years of access to online resources and information. ",

Glenda has been working as a home health aide for the past year, since she was granted asylum status in 2019, and has been living in shelters and with friends and family since she came to the U.S. Glenda has recently saved up enough money for a deposit on her very own apartment and she and her teenage daughter, Jeyssi, moved to their own apartment this month! This is a huge step for Glenda on her journey to self-sufficiency and integration into her new life in New York. She is very proud to finally have her own place to live with her daughter, but they are in need of furniture and other basics. Glenda spent almost all of her savings on renting the apartment, and could use help buying furniture and household items to fill her new home. Glenda and Jeyssi are so thankful for your consideration and any and all donations and support.",

  "donationDescription": "Jennifer is a refugee from Colombia who came to the U.S. in February 2021. She traveled to New York with her husband and four daughters to flee the violence and instability in her home region of Colombia. The family has been working with Catholic Charities and receiving social services. Jennifer and her husband have been working hard to integrate into their new community in Brooklyn by learning English, setting up their home, helping their children in school, and looking for permanent work. Jennifer’s daughters are growing rapidly and need new shoes for the summer. When they arrived in February, the girls were all given winter boots by kind donors, but as the warm weather sets in and the girls grow, they need new shoes already. Jennifer has not yet found work and does not have the spare income to pay for good shoes for her girls. This donation would allow her to keep her children safe and comfortable.",

Yulimar and her family have been living in shelters and with friends and family since they came to the U.S., but this May Yulimar and her husband were able to move into their very own apartment for the first time since they fled Venezuela. This is a huge step for Yulimar and her family on their journey to self-sufficiency and integration into their new lives in New York. She is very proud to finally have her own place to live with her husband and two 12-year-old daughters, but they are in need of furniture and other basics to fill their new home. Yulimar spent almost all of her savings on renting the apartment, and could use help buying furniture and household items needed to turn it into a proper home for her family. Any and all donations and support will be appreciated by Yulimar and her family. ",

This would also allow Aws to keep their own food for himself and his son and have the opportunity to gain food independence from the family members with whom he resides. The mini fridge is not an expense Aws can afford on his own, but it would greatly improve the quality of life for himself and his son. ",

Aws’ son is not enrolled in school yet since it is almost the end of the school year, and he spends a lot of time at home in their small room of Aws’ sister’s apartment because of his mobility issues. Aws would love to get a small SMART TV so that his son could watch shows on a screen further away from him, as their shared tablet is not good for his limited vision. This would allow him to be a kid and enjoy children’s media, and to video chat with family from home on a screen he can see. A television is an expensive item Aws could not afford on his own, but it would help his son find some pleasure in his new life in New York, feel more comfortable in their room,  and help him connect with others from the safety of their room. This donation would be so appreciated by Aws and his son. Thank you for your consideration.",

The sweaters and coats would also come in handy when the weather starts to cool. I would also appreciate some casual shoes and work boots. The shoes I own right now are not very adequate for my work and are pretty worn out. Any and all help is appreciated! Thanks!",

  "donationDescription": "Mohamed is an asylee from Egypt who arrived in the U.S. in 2020, joining his wife and 4 children who were already living in New York. Mohamed spent much of the last year improving his English language skills and working on getting his mechanical engineering license from Egypt approved so he can work in as an engineer the U.S. Mohamed is an excellent engineer and has worked in the field for over 15 years, but he had to leave his career behind to reunite with his family. After a year of getting his credentials ready, learning English, and integrating into his new community in New York, Mohamed is ready to rejoin the workforce. He is proud to provide for his family and is eager to work again. Mohamed and his family have been surviving off their savings since he left Egypt and have very little money left for expenses. Mohamed has been offered an opportunity to apply for a job in his field working on boiler systems in manufacturing facilities, but he must take a training course from the company online before he can get the job, and he is currently unable to do that since he does not have a computer or laptop. Mohamed tried to use his family’s shared cellphone to complete the course, but it must be done on a computer. As an engineer, Mohamed will also need a computer for work if he gets the job. Mohamed does not have the money to buy himself a computer, as it would mean deciding between providing food and clothing for his children and providing for his career, and does not have enough credit in the U.S. to apply for a credit card or loan, as many refugees, asylees, and other immigrants do not. This donation would mean the world to Mohamed, his wife, and their children. It would allow Mohamed to secure the final credentials needed to get on his feet in the U.S. This computer would allow Mohamed to get a job in engineering, to work in his new job, and make money to support his family. A donation of this size would provide Mohamed with the last tool needed to be financially self-sufficient and he and his family would be forever grateful. Thank you for your consideration. ",

The sweaters and coats would also come in handy when the weather starts to cool. I would also appreciate some casual shoes and work boots. The shoes I own right now are not very adequate for my work and are pretty worn out. Any and all help is appreciated! Thanks!",

She came here following her father. She has lived on several farms in Vermont since 2009.  Alejandra has worked hard to get her driver privilege card and to learn English. All of her children attend school in Vermont.  She tries very hard to involve her children in after school activities and spends a lot of time driving them to after school sports activities like soccer and skiing.  Alejandra’s husband works 12 hour shifts with one day off every two weeks. Alejandra has been cooking for farm workers and selling her food to them for several years.  She works hard to earn some money to help support the family and give the children opportunities. After cooking and delivering food to farm workers for several years, she decided to open a taco stand at her home. On Sunday mornings in the warmer months she serves food to farm workers and the general population. She delivered food to students at Middlebury College during the pandemic. People in Addison County have come to know her food and her little taco stand is getting quite popular.  Alejandra has a small shelter where she cooks the food.  But, she does not have seating for people to eat at the taco stand.  She needs a tent, folding tables and chairs to make her venture more welcoming to the public and more successful.",

In January almost exactly 1 year after she was granted status in the U.S., Kpannah was able to save up enough money to start renting a very small apartment in the Bronx for herself and her mother. Her mother is elderly and disabled, and it is difficult for Kpannah to take care of her while working full-time to support them. Kpannah’s mother also wears Depends because she is immobile and must stay home alone in their apartment while Kpannah is at work. These donations of Depends pull-ups and cream will help keep her mother clean, healthy, and safe while Kpannah is at work. This donation will make a big difference in their daily lives and help the family stay healthy without the pressure and financial stress of budgeting for these important and expensive items, as they are not covered by food stamps and would be a large burden on their small budget.",

  "donationDescription": "Kpannah and her mother are refugees from Liberia living in the Bronx. Kpannah is supporting her mother and herself on her minimum wage salary and money is very tight. In January almost exactly 1 year after she was granted status in the U.S., Kpannah was able to save up enough money to start renting a very small apartment in the Bronx for herself and her mother. Her mother is elderly and disabled, and it is difficult for Kpannah to take care of her while working full-time to support them. Kpannah’s mother also wears Depends because she is immobile and must stay home alone in their apartment while Kpannah is at work. These donations of Depends pull-ups and cream will help keep her mother clean, healthy, and safe while Kpannah is at work. This donation will make a big difference in their daily lives and help the family stay healthy without the pressure and financial stress of budgeting for these important and expensive items, as they are not covered by food stamps and would be a large burden on their small budget.",

Richard is a 16-year-old runaway who fled violence and abuse in his home in Ecuador. When he arrived in the U.S., the ORR found his uncle, Wilson, in New York and Wilson agreed to take Richard in and sponsor him in the U.S. While still struggling himself to adjust to life as an immigrant in New York, Wilson is guiding his nephew through this difficult journey.  Richad moved into Wilson’s small one-bedroom apartment last fall and has been attending high school nearby. Wilson is proud of his nephew and happy to support him and raise him, but he often finds it difficult to make ends meet financially for their small family of 2. Wilson and Richard are working with Catholic Charities to get Richard resettled and are receiving social services. As the summer approaches, Wilson’s small apartment is becoming very warm and uncomfortable to be in. They cannot afford an air conditioner, but Wilson and Richard would be so thankful for the donation of a fan to help circulate air in their little apartment. Your donation will go a long way in keeping this family cool, safe, and comfortable this summer. ",

Ayse is also trying to apply for jobs online. A laptop would be such a necessary and helpful gift for this family, as it would allow Filiz to focus on her studies and access her classes more easily and let Ayse job search and learn English online.

Ayse and Ahmed will be so grateful for any help with a device that would allow the family easier access to the internet. Thank you for your consideration.",

Once she arrived into the care of ORR, she gave birth to a baby boy. Katherin and her son were then placed in the care of her older brother as her sponsor, who was already living in the U.S. with his wife and their six children. Katherin moved into their apartment in Roosevelt, NY a few weeks ago. Katherine and her baby are in need of essentials, as they currently have nothing and Katherin has no form of income. Her brother and sister-in-law are currently supporting her, but they have very little extra income to begin with. Katherin is currently sleeping on the couch because the family cannot afford to buy a new bed, with a new mattress. This donation would allow Katherin the dignity of her own bed and give her a more comfortable and permanent place to sleep. Katherin hopes to enroll in high school in the fall and is focused on adjusting to her new life as a mom and a New Yorker. She is very thankful for all the help she has received since she arrived in New York. ",

Her partner works in the restaurant industry and is making enough to pay for rent and thankfully their housing situation is stable. She has been participating in the Healthy Start Program and has learned a lot about what to expect of the pregnancy and much more. As a couple, they have faced many barriers due to the lack of cultural competency among some of our local organizations. At this moment they are safe, excited, and getting ready to bring a baby home soon. It is amazing to to encounter people that never complain about their circumstances. They are thankful for having a roof over their head and a job to go to. It would be even better if they had a bed to sleep on. Thanks!",

Bessy is often visiting hospitals to follow-up with medical care needed for her youngest child. The family only has one income, from Bessy’s partner, and is enough to cover living expenses and medical care for the youngest child. With limited financial resources, the family is saving-up to provide Over with wish list items. Over has stated how much he enjoys sports—boxing is his favorite sport! Over unfortunately fractured his foot earlier this year, and was unable to be as active as he would like due to recovery time. He hopes to one day be able to enroll in boxing classes to stay active doing what he loves. He enjoys spending his time outside playing with friends!

Bessy is often visiting hospitals to follow-up with medical care needed for her youngest child. The family only has one income, from Bessy’s partner, and is enough to cover living expenses and medical care for the youngest child. With limited financial resources, the family is saving-up to provide Over with wish list items. Over has stated how much he enjoys sports—boxing is his favorite sport! Over unfortunately fractured his foot earlier this year, and was unable to be as active as he would like due to recovery time. He hopes to one day be able to enroll in boxing classes to stay active doing what he loves. He enjoys spending his time outside playing with friends!

  "donationDescription": "Edson is from Guatemala, and arrived to the US earlier this year to reunify with his father.  After arriving, he learned that his grandfather back home had been beaten and robbed.  He suffered from a broken shoulder, bruised ribs, and other injuries.  His grandfather relies on Edson's father for financial support, and now needs additional medical treatment that they are struggling to afford.   Additionally, Edson's father has court in two months and is trying to fund legal representation and transportation to court which is more than four hours away. The family would deeply appreciate any financial assistance possible to send home for medical treatment for Edson's grandfather, as well as help related to the upcoming court date.  Walmart gift cards are being requested to fund every day expenses like groceries so that money can be saved to pay for medical and legal expenses. Unaccompanied children served by Catholic Charities Atlanta are children who cross our borders and have no parent or legal guardian who is available to provide for their care and physical custody. For a limited number of Unaccompanied Children, the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement funds home studies and post-release services by social services providers to help ensure children are released into safe placements and to facilitate family and community integration after reunification.",

Edgar could no longer attend school because his family faced financial difficulties. Edgar told his family he wanted to come to the United States to live with his cousin because he wants to finish his studies and eventually send money back to his family. Edgar is adjusting well to his new life but with some difficulties. Edgar and his cousin rent out a room in an apartment. Edgar has noticed that his cousin works very hard in construction and sometimes the pay is not enough to cover all their expenses. Edgar’s cousin wants him to focus on school and not worry about anything else. But for Edgar, it is difficult to ignore his cousin’s efforts. Edgar recently said: “I am grateful for my cousin’s help but sometimes I feel like a burden because he has done a lot for me. I want to help but I am too young and not allowed to work. I need to go to school. Maybe in the future, I can pay him back for all he has done to help me and my family.” \r\n\r\nUnaccompanied children served by Catholic Charities Atlanta are children who cross our borders and have no parent or legal guardian who is available to provide for their care and physical custody.

Edgar is adjusting well to his new life but with some difficulties. Edgar and his cousin rent out a room in an apartment.

Edgar’s cousin wants him to focus on school and not worry about anything else. But for Edgar it is difficult to ignore his cousin’s efforts. Edgar recently said:“I am grateful for my cousin’s help but sometimes I feel like a burden because he has done a lot for me. I want to help but I am too young and not allowed to work.

My three children are still in Africa, and I support them. Since I was a little girl my dream was to become a doctor, but where I grew up, women were expected to take care of the family at home. I could not achieve that dream there.  When I came to America I saw the opportunity to go back to school and become a skilled healthcare worker so I could support myself and my family.    \r\n\r\nI’m finishing my first year in the radiology program at River Valley Community College in Claremont, NH, and it has been going well. The classes are hard, but I study hard.   I use a car to get to classes and the clinicals. Coming home from school one very icy night, another driver rear-ended my car, and it was totaled.  I was fortunately not injured!  \r\n\r\nRight now, I cannot afford to buy a car. Friends are helping me get to classes and the clinicals temporarily, but I cannot depend on them forever.  I do not want to have to drop out of the school program for lack of transportation!\r\n\r\nAfter all the hardships of my life in Africa, going to school and being able to support my children makes me really proud of myself, but  I need some help. A car donation from you will allow me to achieve my goal to become a radiologic technician. I’ll be an example for my kids and the first woman in my family to become a healthcare professional. Thank you.\r\n\r\nI will greatly appreciate your donation. (Original amt $4600)",
